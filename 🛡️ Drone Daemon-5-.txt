This code creates a powerful Windows-based monitoring and defense system called the Drone Daemon + GUI Console. Here's what it does, step by step, in plain English:

🛡️ 1. Elevation Check (Admin Rights)
• 	When the script starts, it checks if it's running with administrator privileges.
• 	If not, it automatically relaunches itself with elevated rights using the Windows UAC prompt.
• 	This is required to access protected registry keys and network data.

🔗 2. Socket Server for Real-Time Communication
• 	A local socket server is started on port 5050.
• 	This server allows the background daemon to send live system events to the GUI.

🧠 3. Registry Monitoring
• 	The script watches specific Windows registry settings (like telemetry and firewall).
• 	It detects:
• 	Flip-flops: when a setting changes rapidly back and forth (a sign of instability or tampering).
• 	Mutations: when a setting changes from its original value.
• 	It takes snapshots every 30 seconds to compare and log mutations.

🔐 4. Lock System with Auto-Restore
• 	The script loads a file called  that defines which registry settings should be locked.
• 	If any locked setting is changed:
• 	It logs the mutation.
• 	If configured, it automatically restores the original value.
• 	This protects critical system settings from unauthorized changes.

🌐 5. Connection Tracker
• 	It monitors all active network connections on the system.
• 	For each connection, it logs:
• 	The process name
• 	The process ID (PID)
• 	The remote IP and port

🧙 6. GUI Console
• 	A graphical interface is launched using Tkinter.
• 	It has four panels:
1. 	Flip-Flop Matrix: shows unstable registry settings
2. 	Connection Tracker: shows active network connections
3. 	Mutation Log: shows changes to monitored registry settings
4. 	Lock Status: shows violations of locked settings and whether they were restored

🔄 7. Real-Time Updates
• 	The daemon sends all events (flip-flops, mutations, connections, lock violations) to the GUI over the socket.
• 	The GUI updates live as events occur.

🧩 Summary
This script is a mythic-grade system integrity sentinel. It:
• 	Elevates itself for full system access
• 	Monitors registry and network activity
• 	Detects and logs suspicious changes
• 	Enforces locked settings with optional auto-restore
• 	Displays everything in a live GUI dashboard
