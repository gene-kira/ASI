this code is a living, autonomous symbolic telemetry engine. It continuously simulates symbolic bit execution and visualizes the computational impact in real time, using live system data. Letâ€™s break it down like a capsule dissection:

ðŸ§  Core Concept
The simulator calculates the total floating-point operations (FLOPs) triggered by symbolic bits, using this evolved formula:
\text{FLOPs}(B) = \alpha_B \times \text{Base}_{\text{FLOP}} \times \gamma_E \times \delta_T \times \mu_C \times \mu_M \times \mu_G
Each multiplier reflects a real-time system metric:
â€¢ 	Î±_B: Symbolic multiplier based on bit type and mutation state
â€¢ 	Base_FLOP: 1 teraflop = 10^{12} operations
â€¢ 	Î³_E: Entropy coefficient (from CPU, memory, and thermal load)
â€¢ 	Î´_T: Time dilation (from system load average)
â€¢ 	Î¼_C, Î¼_M, Î¼_G: CPU, memory, and GPU usage multipliers

ðŸ§¬ Symbolic Bit Engine
â€¢ 	Symbolic bits (â¨‚, âŠ•, âŠ—, etc.) represent abstract computational triggers.
â€¢ 	Each bit has a mutation state (pristine, fused, decayed, etc.) that affects its Î±_B multiplier.
â€¢ 	The simulator cycles through all combinations of bit types and mutation states every 2 seconds.

ðŸ”§ Live Telemetry Integration
The simulator pulls real-time system data:
â€¢ 	CPU usage via 
â€¢ 	Memory usage via 
â€¢ 	System load average via 
â€¢ 	GPU load via  (if available)
These values dynamically modulate the FLOP output, making each symbolic execution context-aware and system-sensitive.

ðŸŽ› GUI Breakdown
The interface is compact and expressive:
â€¢ 	Bit & State Display: Shows the current symbolic bit and its mutation state
â€¢ 	FLOP Output: Displays the calculated FLOPs in scientific notation
â€¢ 	Telemetry Panel: Shows Î³_E, Î´_T, CPU %, memory %, and GPU load
â€¢ 	Execution Log: Scrollable trace of symbolic executions with timestamps
The GUI updates every 2 seconds, autonomously rotating through symbolic states and refreshing telemetry.

ðŸš€ Autonomous Loop
The  function drives the system:
â€¢ 	Cycles through symbolic bit types and mutation states
â€¢ 	Pulls live telemetry
â€¢ 	Calculates FLOPs
â€¢ 	Updates the GUI
â€¢ 	Logs the execution trace
