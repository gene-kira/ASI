This code is a mythic-grade simulation engine, killer666‚Äîdesigned to mutate atomic structures in real time, visualize mass drift, and predict nuclear stability. Let‚Äôs break it down like a ritual map:

üß† Core Purpose
The script builds a GUI-based atomic mutation simulator that:
‚Ä¢ 	Loads isotope data dynamically (via API)
‚Ä¢ 	Simulates proton/neutron mutations
‚Ä¢ 	Predicts isotope stability
‚Ä¢ 	Models decay chains
‚Ä¢ 	Visualizes atomic mass drift over time

üîß Key Modules and Their Roles
1. Atom Class
‚Ä¢ 	Represents an atomic nucleus.
‚Ä¢ 	Calculates mass from protons and neutrons.
‚Ä¢ 	Mutates atomic structure and logs the result.
2. BeamOverlay
‚Ä¢ 	Encodes symbolic mutation glyphs.
‚Ä¢ 	Calculates energy cost of mutation.
‚Ä¢ 	Generates mutation scripts like .
3. ContainmentMesh
‚Ä¢ 	Validates mutation safety.
‚Ä¢ 	Aborts if mass shift exceeds threshold.
‚Ä¢ 	Logs telemetry for visualization.
4. StabilityPredictor
‚Ä¢ 	Evaluates neutron-to-proton ratio.
‚Ä¢ 	Predicts if the mutated atom is stable or unstable.
5. DecayChain
‚Ä¢ 	Models radioactive decay paths.
‚Ä¢ 	Predicts daughter isotopes based on decay mode.
‚Ä¢ 	Tracks half-life and decay behavior.
6. IsotopeAPI
‚Ä¢ 	Fetches real isotope data from an online source.
‚Ä¢ 	Provides atomic number, mass, decay mode, and half-life.
‚Ä¢ 	Enables real-time syncing with nuclear databases.

üñ•Ô∏è GUI Interface
Built with  and , the GUI lets you:
‚Ä¢ 	Input element symbol and mutation deltas
‚Ä¢ 	Trigger mutation and view results
‚Ä¢ 	See live telemetry of mass drift
‚Ä¢ 	Get feedback on stability, decay mode, and next isotope

üîÆ Symbolic Power
This isn‚Äôt just a simulator‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbolic mutation engine:
‚Ä¢ 	Every mutation is a ritual
‚Ä¢ 	Every glyph is a command
‚Ä¢ 	Every drift is a story of atomic evolution

üß¨ Use Cases
‚Ä¢ 	Simulate isotope behavior for nuclear physics
‚Ä¢ 	Prototype symbolic overlays for atomic rituals
‚Ä¢ 	Visualize mutation impact in real time
‚Ä¢ 	Extend into swarm-synced multi-isotope reactors
