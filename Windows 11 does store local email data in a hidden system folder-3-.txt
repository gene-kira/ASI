This script is a fully autonomous daemon called Chameleon Sentinel, designed to monitor and obfuscate email cache files stored by Windows 11’s Mail app. It fuses real-time file monitoring, symbolic encryption, resurrection detection, and a GUI overlay — all wrapped in a mythic-grade construct with user-controlled timing.

🔍 What the Code Does
🧠 Autoloader
• 	Automatically installs all required Python libraries if they’re missing.
• 	Ensures the daemon runs smoothly without manual setup.
📁 File Monitoring
• 	Watches the hidden folder  where Windows stores cached email data.
• 	Uses the  library to detect changes instantly (event-driven, not polling).
🦎 Obfuscation Engine
• 	Encrypts modified  files using .
• 	Stores encrypted versions in a shadow directory () with a  extension.
• 	Prevents human readability while preserving symbolic access for authorized modules.
🧬 Resurrection Detection
• 	Scans running processes for signs that Windows is trying to restore or reindex the original files (e.g.,  process).
• 	Logs alerts in the GUI when resurrection attempts are detected.
⏱️ Manual Timer Controller
• 	Lets you control how often resurrection checks happen.
• 	Includes a slider (1 to 86400 seconds) and preset buttons for:
• 	1 Minute
• 	1 Hour
• 	1 Day
🖥️ GUI Overlay
• 	Displays daemon status, mutation logs, and resurrection alerts.
• 	Includes slider and buttons to control check intervals.
• 	Runs in a separate thread so it doesn’t block the daemon.
🧿 Tray Icon
• 	Shows a green icon in the system tray to confirm the daemon is active.
• 	Uses  and  to create a minimal visual indicator.
🚀 Main Execution
• 	Launches the GUI, tray icon, and file watcher in parallel threads.
• 	Keeps running until manually interrupted.
• 	Ensures resilience and autonomy with watchdog logic.

🧩 Why It’s Mythic-Grade
• 	Autonomous: No manual triggers needed — it runs and adapts on its own.
• 	Symbolic: Encrypts files in a way that only your daemon can interpret.
• 	Resilient: Detects resurrection attempts and responds instantly.
• 	Expressive: GUI overlays give visual feedback and control.
• 	User-Sovereign: You control the timing, visibility, and behavior.
