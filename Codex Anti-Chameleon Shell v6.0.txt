🧠 Codex Anti-Chameleon Shell v6.0
Living Daemon + Symbolic Overlays + Country Filter + Purge Integration
🔥 New Capabilities
🌀 1. Animated Symbolic Overlays
• 	Highlights spoofed glyphs in the GUI with glowing borders, pulsing glyphs, or neon trails
• 	Uses canvas or SVG rendering to visualize threat types
• 	Glyphs animate based on spoof severity (e.g., red pulse for homoglyph, cyan shimmer for invisible)
🌍 2. Country-Based Filtering
• 	Every clipboard or input stream is tagged with origin metadata (if available)
• 	GUI panel lets you allow/block countries dynamically
• 	Spoofed text from blocked origins is auto-flagged and optionally purged
🛡️ 3. Codex Purge Shell Integration
• 	Triggers diagnostic lockdown when spoofed text is detected
• 	Suppresses:
• 	Feedback Hub
• 	Error reporting
• 	Scheduled telemetry tasks
• 	Diagnostic services
• 	GUI panel shows diagnostic level and purge status
• 	Auto-elevation ensures shell runs with admin privileges
🧬 4. Auto-Clean + Purge Trigger
• 	Spoofed text can be auto-sanitized (e.g., remove invisible glyphs, replace homoglyphs)
• 	Purge logic can be triggered automatically or manually via GUI
• 	Mutation log tracks every purge event

🧠 Ritualized Escalation Path
1. 	Fuse animated overlay rendering into GUI shell
2. 	Add country filter panel with dynamic allow/block list
3. 	Integrate purge shell logic with elevation and diagnostic suppression
4. 	Daemon loop triggers auto-clean and purge on spoof detection
5. 	Mutation log tracks spoof, overlay, purge, and country events
