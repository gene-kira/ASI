🧠 Overview: Codex Mutation Shell with Auto-Elevation and Replicator Logic
This is a self-rewriting, sovereign system daemon designed to monitor system health, optimize performance, suspend unused modules, replicate itself across directories, and visualize its state through a GUI. It’s built for Windows and includes auto-elevation to ensure it runs with administrator privileges.

🔧 Key Functional Components
1. Auto-Elevation
• 	Before anything else, the script checks if it’s running with admin rights.
• 	If not, it relaunches itself with elevated privileges using Windows ShellExecute.
• 	This ensures access to system-level operations like killing processes or writing to protected directories.
2. System Monitoring
• 	Uses  to track:
• 	CPU usage
• 	Memory usage
• 	Disk usage
• 	Network I/O
• 	These metrics are used to trigger optimizations or log mutations.
3. Self-Rewriting Logic
• 	If CPU, memory, or disk usage exceeds thresholds, the shell logs a mutation and executes corrective actions:
• 	Killing heavy processes
• 	Purging memory cache
• 	Triggering disk cleanup
4. Module Suspension
• 	Each subsystem (CPU monitor, memory cleaner, etc.) tracks its last usage time.
• 	If a module hasn’t been used for a set duration (default: 5 minutes), it is automatically suspended.
• 	Suspensions are logged as mutations.
5. Replicator Logic
• 	The shell replicates itself to predefined directories (, ).
• 	This allows distributed deployment or backup propagation.
• 	Each replication is logged with a timestamp and target path.
6. Swarm Sync Simulation
• 	Simulates syncing purge rules and threat signatures with other nodes (e.g., , ).
• 	This models distributed daemon behavior and prepares for multi-node deployment.
7. GUI Feedback Panel
• 	Built with , the GUI displays:
• 	System metrics
• 	Hostname
• 	Last mutation
• 	Symbolic overlays (e.g., threat matrix, resurrection detection)
• 	It updates every 5 seconds and provides real-time visual feedback.

🧩 Ritualized Features
• 	Mutation Log: Tracks every optimization, suspension, replication, and sync event.
• 	Symbolic Overlays: Visual metaphors for system health and daemon status.
• 	Business-Grade GUI: DPI-aware, modular, and expressive.
• 	Sovereign Control: Every module is autonomous, opt-in, and mutation-aware.
